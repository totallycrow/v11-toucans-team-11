          core technologies like TypeScript or Spring Boot are you running? How
          many versions of any particular library? The answers will surprise

      <h2>Get control of your code and process</h2>
      <p>
        Drift is the divergence of your code and configuration from where you
        would want it to be, from an ideally current state. It happens over time
        and typically goes unnoticed until something breaks or an exploit
        happens. Tame drift with Atomist.
